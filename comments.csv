The summary of the video is-
 0. experience is the key
1. Keep moving on- practice a problem 2-3 times only
2. Face new problems -every single day learn new things.
3. Check code written by others- learn methods and mistakes done by others- GitHub and open source libraries
4. Take help from Stack overflow- learn problems from above community of programmers. Search on Google also for solution 
5. Work on projects- build real life projects , move on on different languages- app, website, calculator etc.",0,2019-08-13T08:59:36Z,0.04458874458874459

123,Positive Comment,Meet Div,"Hey you videos are cool, but imho this one deals with ""how to prevent programmer burnouts"" more than it explains how to build logic.

Simple steps would be -
1) identify the problem ex. print even numbers from 1 through 10
2) identify steps that need to be taken to arrive at an even number (n % 2 === 0)
3) check each instance of the problem to see if it satisfies given conditions ex. from 1 through 10
4) build a flow chart of the rough design
5) start coding as per flow chart

Writing code is actually not that important. The logic is. Code is just telling the computer what to do in its mother tongue.",15,2018-01-18T12:54:40Z,0.19166666666666665
